Analytics was started by [Edward Kmett](https://github.com/ekmett) in response to a question by [Alec Heller](https://github.com/deviant-logic) about if he should use `bound` to implement datalog. It has since somewhat expanded in scope.

`hyperloglog` was split out of the `analytics` repository, and borrows innovations from [Ozgun Ataman](https://github.com/soostone)'s implementation of `HyperLogLog` in Haskell as well as twitter's `algebird` project.

You can watch contributors carry on the quest for bragging rights in the [contributors graph](https://github.com/analytics/compensated/graphs/contributors).

Omission from this list is by no means an attempt to discount your contribution.

Thank you for all of your help!
